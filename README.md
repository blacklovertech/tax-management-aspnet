# Tax-Management-aspnet on Asp.Net

**Online Tax Information System** is a internet-based application developed in ASP.NET platform. Based on [database](https://google.com/database-management-system-project-c-wxwidgets/) integration approach, it uses MS [SQL Server](https://google.com/best-way-to-connect-a-c-c-application-to-a-old-sql-server-database/) as back-end database. This project is titled “Geo Spatial Info Tech Solutions”, and is aimed at automated, web-based tax management in the municipal region of a country.

The proposed system provides user registration with various tax-related information through which users can log in to the system and see their tax details. It provides an effective solution to collect information regarding house, water, etc. and see details of due payment.

This project is complete with all necessary [source code](https://google.com/c-projects-with-source-code/), database, documentation, project report and ppt available in the download links. The project report contains project [abstract](https://google.com/abstract-base-class-with-metaclass-python-programming/) and detailed introduction along with [data](https://google.com/data-visualization-java-project/) flow diagrams, collaboration diagrams, tables, activity diagrams, use case diagrams and class diagrams.

About Online Tax Information System Project:
--------------------------------------------

Local bodies in a nation such as municipalities and similar government offices collect taxes from citizens. The tax includes services provided by the municipality such as drinking water, household electricity, street light, land, etc. But in the existing system, the tax payment procedure is not easy.

**Existing System:**

The existing tax information management system requires citizens to go to municipal offices to pay the tax. This is a very time taking process as citizens have to wait for officials and collect the necessary bill for payment. The chances of corruption cannot be ruled out here.

Tax information are saved by municipal employees in the form of excel sheets or disk drives. So, data is not secure as they are not properly managed. Searching a particular information may take hours of time, and gathering information from different sources is a very tedious job.

**Proposed System:**

Keeping this issues in mind, the need for an automated tax management system was felt. The proposed system collects tax information from all citizens and different authorities based on the house number and owner’s name. All these records are stored in the database of the system, which can be viewed by the users or citizens at any time.

Actually, the project requires users to register into the system with the house number and owner name. Then, users can log in to the system and search for tax details; this will show their payment and pending amount. The bill for each citizen is automatically calculated by the system annually, semi-annually or quarterly.

Users can view the following details after being logged into the system:

*   House details (house number and owner name)
*   Electricity bill  details
*   Water bill details
*   Municipality details
*   Pending bills
*   Dues (amount and date), penalties and other payments

### Modules Overview:

Online Tax Information System project is built with the following **aspects/modules**:

*   **Administrator**: Admin maintains and manages the entire system; they are provided with the privilege of adding, updating or deleting anything to/from the system database.
*   **Registration**: Users of the system, i.e. the citizens, need to register by providing the house number and house owner name. They are then provided a unique user name id and password to log in to the system.
*   **Citizens**: Using the system, citizens can view various bill amounts, pending amounts and dues to be paid to different authorities.
*   **Citizen Bill Information**: This includes         electricity bills, water bills, property taxes, etc.
*   Search
